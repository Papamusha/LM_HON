This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.(https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a prototype tool, a web-application which renders social media (dummy data) data visualisations, this is a showcase of functionality and does not reflect what a potential fully completed version of this project would look like, nor does this reflect how it would function.

## How to use

Before you can run the project, you should actualise a react project in your IDE using the command:

### `npx create-react-app 'insert-name-here'`

Then you should input these commands to acquire dependencies:

### `npm install --save topojson`
### `npm install --save react-d3-library`
### `npm install --save react-scripts`
### `npm install --save react-bootstrap`
### `npm install --save react-router-dom`
### `npm install --save bootstrap`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in your browser.\
If the project will not run without error it is likely a dependency issue, try reinstalling the dependencies.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation.**
